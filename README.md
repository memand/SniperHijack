# 🐍 Sniper Hijack Strategy

Let sniper bots pump the chart. You walk away with the profits.

This repo outlines a memecoin trading strategy that **rewards everyone**—snipers included. It doesn’t rely on honeypots or freezing wallets. Instead, it turns sniper behavior into predictable market events that can be monetized transparently and sustainably.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- Target legit memecoins (burned mint, locked LP, no rug risks)
- Let sniper bots do their pump + dump routine
- Absorb the dump with size
- Stabilize and let real users take over
- Exit slowly, predictably, and profitably

Everyone wins.

## 📈 Strategy Flow

1. **Wait for Snipers**
   - Monitor fresh token launches
   - Identify early sniper activity

2. **Absorb Dump**
   - Let bots sell into low liquidity
   - You buy the bottom with size

3. **Stabilize**
   - Hold majority LP
   - Reduce volatility
   - Promote fairness and community trust

4. **Exit Gradually**
   - Sell a fixed % daily
   - Always at a public, predictable time (e.g., 18:00 UTC)

## 💰 Why This Works

- **Snipers exit fast:** You catch their dumps.
- **You provide stability:** A real floor builds.
- **No dev privileges needed:** You’re just a smart trader.
- **Predictability earns trust:** The community stays calm.

No freeze mechanics. No shady contracts. Just discipline and edge.

## 🧪 Ideal Token Targets
